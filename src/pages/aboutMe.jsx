        <p>My name is Crystal and I am a Mother to 2 children, a wife, and a loyal family member and friend to many. I have been searching for a while to find the thing in my life most refer to as a career. I have done many things in my time on earth so far but have had some challenges, as many do in life, that made doing what I love difficult, and has brought me to this new and exciting chapter. I have held positions in sales, banking and loan services, consumer services, cosmetology (which I still hold a license for), a paraprofessional and teacher (substitute and special ed teachers aide), as well as in the health care industry. I have a unique perspective because of that background and intent to use that to help me in any position I may hold in the future. 
        I am a person who enjoys creating and discovering, who is curious and always looking to learn new things. I am easy to collaborate and work with. I have always been a team player but do also enjoy being able to work alone. I hold myself to a high standard and have an old school work ethic that is lacking in todays markets. I learn from watching and doing but, pick things up fairly quickly. I am looking forward to my future in the Software Engineering & Coding business. See you there. </p>
